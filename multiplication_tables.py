# Learning multiplication tables
# By Lowell Gautier and his dad (as an exercice for both of them to start learning Python.)
# Inspired by a lost old GWBASIC program dad wrote for my brother and I, a long, long time ago.
# Written an tested only on Windows OS but should be easy to port to Linux, etc. (Remove the colorama module and port the winsound lines)
#
# Algorithm:
# * Ask for all operations randomly in a selected range, until they are all KNOWN.
# * If the first answer to an operation is right, do not ask again this operation, it assumed to be KNOWN.
# * If not, then 2 consecutive answers will be required for this operation. It will then be assumed to be KNOWN and so no longer asked again.
# * ("Consecutive" for this operation but probably separated by other operations because operations are asked randomly choosed among the remaining UNKNOWN operations.) 
# * Minimalist display so that the pupil only sees the operation. A typed answer is immediately replaced with the display of the right answer.
# * At the end, display the time/operation score, then the operations that were not answered right at first time. (i.e. had at least 1 wrong answer.)
# This algorithm will at the end ask again and again the same unknown operations. Repetition leads to memorization.

this_version = '3.3'
# History:
# v.3.3 2019-03-24: English version with some small ajustements.
# v.3.2 2018-08-21: 
#    * improved input of from_table, to_table and operation's result so that it does not stops when a letter is typed, neagtive values, etc.
#    * At the end, display the operations which had bad answers, even only one
#    * nb_consecutive_right_answers_required variable for the number of required consecutive good answers required if the 1st answer was not good (set to 2 so no change yet)
